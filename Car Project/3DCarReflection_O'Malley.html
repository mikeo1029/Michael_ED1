<h1> 3D Car Reflection </h1>

<p> This is a reflection on the work I did with 3D modeling. </p>

<h3> Guidelines </h3> 
<ul>
<li> Car designed as an intersection of three forms </li>
<li> Design car in a 1:1 ratio </li>
<li> Size accuracy +/- 1% </li>
<li> Design is exported as stl </li>
<li> Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
<li> File is exported as a code </li>
<li> Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<figure> 
<p> <i> Drawing: </i> </p>
<ul>
<li> Draw car to scale as an Engineering Drawing </li>
<li> Scan or photograph drawing </li>
<li> Capture screenshots of each plane slide </li>
</ul>
<p> <i> 3D Modeling: </i> </p>
<ul>
<li> Draw each profile on each plane side </li>
<li> Using the extrusion tool, remove the negative spaces from the 3D form </li>
<li> Using extrusion tool, remove the negative spaces from the 3D form </li>
<li> Use the extrusion and fillet tools for finish details </li>
<li> Export STL file </li>
</ul>
<p> <i> Slicing and Printing: </i> </p>
<ul>
<li> Import design to Cura (make any final changes, position 3D model on build plate, setting to .6mm nozzle) </li>
<li> Export as a GCODE file </li>
<li> Print model </li>
</ul>
<p> <i> Documentation: </p> </i>
<ul>
<li> CAD drawing with margin of error analysis </li>
<li> Import design into Modelo to make a 3D model </li>
<li> Reflection will be a HTML document with blurb and 3D render </li>
<li> Add photo of car next to model into Slide Deck </li> 
</ul>

<h3> Process </h3> 
<figure> 
<p> For my 3D car, I chose a traditional pickup truck. I started the process by taking the length, width, and height measurements of the car, keeping all my units in millimeters. I used said measurements to create my engineering drawing. The engineering drawing serves as an overall outline for the final product. The OnShape process involved creating a rectangle to the exact dimensions of the car. Screenshots of the engineering drawing were scaled onto each side of the cube to serve as tracing guide. I then used the pen tool to trace the engineering drawing images, ensuring I had the most precise picture of the car possible. I then extruded all of the negative space around my drawing, and it took the shape of my car. The next step involved adding fillets and wheels to make the final print more realistic. Finally, I moved my design into Ultimaker Cura and prepared the shape to be printed in the best way possible regarding necessary support for the figure. </p>

<h3> Setbacks and Solutions </h3>
<figure>
<p> One of the most significant setbacks I had during this project was making the extrusions in between the wheels underneath the car. This involved creating special rectangles on the underside of the car that would be extruded upwards into the body of the car. This was an inherent challenge, as the extrusion had to be flush with the bottom of the car for the final product. After much trial and error, I was finally able to make the bottom of the car flush. Another challenge came from the use of a new software, OnShape. Everyone in the group was inexperienced with the software, and some of its features are not as easy to use as those of programs such as Adobe Illustrator. However, through significant amounts of teamwork, I was able to overcome the hurdles of using a new software. </p>
